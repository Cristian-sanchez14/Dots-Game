# Project 2 - DOTS: The Game

![Dots](https://res.cloudinary.com/ahonore42/image/upload/v1611106862/ga/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_7.40.44_PM_hf3sgr.png)

## Overview
In this project, we'll be building Dots with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Dots is an interactive game with up to 3 levels. In each level, the user has to click a moving ball until they reach a certain score, at which point they can move on to the next level. This game will test your skills with DOM manipulation, event listeners and applying conditional game logic.

## Objectives
- Use DOM manipulation with event handling to create a functional Dots browser game
- The game should be able to track player scores
- The game should display winning messages when a player completes a level
- Gain a deeper understanding of creating conditional game logic and applying it to create a working game

## What You'll Be Building

## Getting Started
- `Fork` and `clone` this repository and `cd` into the new directory on your local machine
- Open the directory in your text editor with `code .`
- You will be working inside the `starter` directory, where initial code has been provided
- Take a look at the files inside the `starter` directory before beginning to see how they are connected with each other
- From the starter directory, `open index.html` to test your game in the browser

## Instructions
- After opening your game in your browser, open your Chrome dev tools, as they will be vital in testing your game's functionality
- `cmd + option + i` for MacOS
- `ctrl + shift + i` for Windows/Linux

## Level 1
For level 1, you'll need to add a single event listener to the `.js-ball` element. When the user clicks on the ball, it should increment their score by 10 points. When the user reaches 100 points, they've beat the level and can move on!

### Setup
We'll be working in `level-one.html` and `level-one.js` to accomplish these goals. Let's take a look at `level-one.html` to see what HTML elements we'll be working with first.

- Inside the section with a class of `level-arena` we have a span tag with the classes `ball js-ball`
- Inside the header tag, we also have an h2 tag with a classes `score js-score`
- We also have a section with the class of `level-winner`, which is not currently appearing because it has an opacity of 0 in its CSS rules
- We'll need to use these elements to create the game functionality for Level 1

Now, in `level-one.js` we'll need to create a few necessary variables to start.
- At the top of `level-one.js` create a `score` variable with an initial value of `0`
- We'll also need to create variables to allow access to our HTML elements and control their behavior
  - Create a variable `ball` and assign its value by grabbing the `.js-ball` class with a `querySelector()`
  - Create a variable `scoreDisplay` and assign its value to the `js-score` class
  - Create a variable `levelWinner` and assign its value to the `level-winner` class

### Functionality
- To create the game functionality we want with Level 1, we'll need to start by adding an event listener to the `ball` variable (which is the HTML element with class `js-ball`) we've just created
- This event listener will need an anonymous callback function to perform the logic of our game when the `ball` is `clicked`
- At this point, your event listener should look like this:
```js
ball.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // some logic for updating score and checking for a win here
});
```
For our game to work we'll need to add logic inside the event listener's callback function. What should happen when the `ball` is `clicked`?
- Make sure to `console.log` with each step to be sure your logic is working properly!
  - Firstly, we should increment the `score` by `10` 
  - Next, we'll need to make sure that a player sees that their score has gone up
  - Set the `innerText` property of `scoreDisplay` equal to `score` to accomplish this
  - Finally, what needs to happen if a player's `score` reaches `100`?
  - Write a conditional statement that checks if the player's `score` is `greater than or equal to 100`
  - If their `score` is at or above `100` we'll need to reflect that by showing the player that they've beaten the level
  - To show that the player has won, we'll need to target `opacity` within the `style` property of `levelWinner` and set its value to `1`
- Now when a player interacts with Level 1, their `score` display should update as they click the `ball` and they should have a win message appear when their `score` reaches `100`!

And with that, we've completed Level 1! Great work!

## Level 2
Level 2 has 3 moving balls that the user can click on to increment their score. Implement a single click handler to listen for when a user clicks on one of the balls and increment their until they reach 100.

### Setup
We'll be working in `level-two.html` and `level-two.js` for Level 2. Let's start with `level-two.html` to see what HTML elements we'll be working with.

- In `level-two.html` we now have 3 elements with a class of `js-ball`
- How might we set all 3 elements to a variable?
- We also have an h2 tag with a class of `js-score` and a section tag with a class of `level-winner`

To start we'll need variables for each of these elements along with a variable to track `score` as the balls are `clicked` in `level-two.js`
- `querySelectorAll()` will output an array of elements with the same class. 
- It might be useful to set a variable equal to this array
- `console.log` this variable to see it with your Chrome dev tools

### Functionality
How might we add a `click` event listener to each ball element within an array?
- A `loop` may be useful here
- <details><summary>HINT</summary><p>
  
  A `for loop` can be used to add an event listener with the same callback function to *each* HTML element in an array output by `querySelectorAll()`
  
  ```js
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.js-ball');
  for (let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
    elements[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
       // some logic for updating score and checking for a win here
    });
  };
  ```

  </p>
  </details>
- We'll need several things to happen each time a `ball` element is clicked
  - The `score` should be incremented up by `10`
  - The player should see their updated score reflected in the browser
  - Finally, if the player's score reaches `100`, they should see a winning message and be able to move on to the next level

Once this logic is completed, we're done with Level 2!


## Level 3
Level 3 also has 3 moving balls but of different sizes! Each ball is therefore worth a different amount of points. The number of points the user should get for each ball is saved in side of a data attribute on the ball HTML elements. You can access the data attribute of an element from the event object by looking at the event target's `dataset` property. When the user clicks on a ball, increment their score based on how many points that ball is worth until they reach 100.

### Setup
Like in Level 2, we also have 3 ball elements in Level 3 with a class of `js-ball`, an h2 tag with a `js-score` class, and a section tag with a class of `level-winner`.

- We'll need to create necessary variables to track player `score` and allow interactions with the HTML elements
- This can be accomplished in a similar fashion to variables in Level 2

### Functionality
Since we have balls of different sizes in Level 3 that have different values, how to we use that in our logic?
- First we'll need to add a `click` event listener for each ball with the `js-ball` class
- Next, when a ball is clicked, we'll need to increment the score by each ball's `data-increment` value
- This can be accomplished in several ways
  - <details><summary>HINT 1</summary><p>
  
    Inside your event listener for each ball, `console.log` the `dataset` property of the ball. 
    ```js
    console.log(ball.dataset)
    ```
    Notice that the `dataset` property also has an `increment` property. 

    How might this be used to get the point value of the ball?
    </p>
    </details>
  - <details><summary>HINT 2</summary><p>
  
    Notice that `data-increment` is an *attribute* of each ball element.
    
    `getAttribute()` is a useful method that allows us to target HTML element attributes. Try a `console.log` of this method inside of the ball's event listener callback function.

    ```js
    console.log(ball.getAttribute('data-increment'))
    ```
    
    </p>
    </details>
- Now that we've accessed the increment value of each ball, we'll need to set it to a variable so we'll have access to it in our event listener callback function and make sure that the value is actually an integer value, since this is not guranteed
- `parseInt()` is a useful method that can ensure the value is actually a number data type
- Once we've set this value to a variable, we'll need to update the `score` with it, then reflect the updated score in the player's score display 
- Finally, we'll need logic to allow a player to win the level if their score reaches `100`

Once this logic is completed, Level 3 is finished! Congrats!

## Recap
In this project, we used DOM manipulation in multiple scripts and HTML files to access HTML elements as variables, then used event listeners with callback functions to allow for conditional game logic in our Dot game. Key concepts covered in this lab include:
- Variables can be used in JavaScript to affect live HTML through the DOM
- `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()` are used to access HTML elements in JavaScript by their classes with the DOM (Document Object Model), with the latter returning an *array* of selected HTML elements
- `.addEventListener()` is used to handle events for a DOM element. It requires at least 2 arguments:
  - First, the `type` of event being listened for needs to be specified. Commonly used events include: `click`,`DOMContentLoaded`, and `mouseover` but a full list can be found here: [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#standard_events)
  - Secondly, something needs to happen once the event being listened for occurs, a *callback* function! The callback function is typically an *anonymous* function `() => {}` or a pre-defined function that determine website behaviour after the event occurs.
- `for loops` can be used to alter multiple elements within an array, including DOM elements
- The `dataset` property of an HTML element allows us to access their custom data attributes 
- `.getAttribute()` allows access to the *attributes* of a DOM element
- `parseInt()` can be used to ensure that the data type of a variable is a number
- Conditional logic (control flow) is a hugely important aspect in determining the *behavior* of a website
